    "This notebook demonstrates how a text tokenizer can be used to turn a corpus of text into a matrix of numeric values that then can be used in regulat machine learning applications. This way a model can be trained to predict labels with a piece of text as input. As can be seen at the end of the notebook, a test string is used as input and the machine gives a probability for each of the possible labels.\n",

    "The dataset used in this notebook originates from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tariqsays/sentiment-dataset-with-1-million-tweets). A 100000 random sample from the English negative, uncertainty and positive observations was taken, so no litigious and no other languages.\n",

Technically it is possible to increase these values at the cost of training time and possibly increasing the outcome quality, however, in this case even dramatic increases seemed to create mere insignificant improvements. The vectorizer then turns the corpus of texts (5000 observations) in numeric representations for the 100 most prominent words excluding the stop words of the English language. For every observation it will give a `0` for any word that is not present in the observation, or a higher value for a word that is.
